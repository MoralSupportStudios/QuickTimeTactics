# QuickTimeTactics
QuickTimeTactics is a single-player, turn-based, WebGL game inspired by the combat system from LucasArts' Gladius. This is a hobby project, primarily designed to be hosted on a WordPress website.

## Game Overview
QuickTimeTactics is a strategy game where characters battle in a grid-based arena. The combat is based on quicktime events: Matching, Swing Meter, and Button Mashing. Both the player's and the AI-controlled characters take turns to move and attack based on their speed. The game is set in a 3D environment, using the A* pathfinding algorithm for grid paths and providing an engaging player experience. Additional strategic depth is added with features such as elevation-based damage and directional attacks.

## Installation
This section will be updated as the project progresses. Currently, the game is still in development.

## Project Structure
The project uses Unity for game development and Jira for project management, employing the Scrum framework. Major components of the game are categorized into Epics, with sub-tasks defined as Stories.

## Contributing
Currently, this project is being developed by a small group of hobbyists and is not open to outside contributions. However, feel free to fork the project and experiment on your own!
